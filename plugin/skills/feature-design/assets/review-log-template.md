# Review Log — Two-Factor Authentication

> Template owned by `feature-design` skill. Producer: `feature-design-lead` collates reviewer rounds during Wave 2 + Wave 3. One section per reviewer per round. A round is "approved" only when every reviewer's verdict in that round is `approved`. Findings carry a severity (`blocker`, `major`, `minor`, `nit`) and a fix instruction the author can act on without follow-up clarification.

## Reviewers

- `product-manager` (PRD coherence, scope, success metrics)
- `solution-architect` (interface contracts, integration with adjacent services)
- `system-architect` (component decomposition, data flow, non-functional posture)

## Round 1 — Wave 2 cross-check (changes_requested)

### product-manager — verdict: `changes_requested`

| # | Severity | File / Section | Finding | Fix instruction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | major | `PRD.md` § Success metrics | "60% Enterprise opt-in within 30 days" — no baseline measurement plan; we cannot compute opt-in without a per-tenant denominator and a daily snapshot job | Add a "Measurement plan" subsection: data source (`tenant_users.2fa_enabled` snapshot), aggregation (`COUNT(2fa_enabled) / COUNT(*)` per tenant, daily), dashboard owner (analytics-engineer), alert threshold (deviation > 10% from forecast). Also list the cohort definition (Enterprise plan ≥ 100 seats, account age ≥ 30 days) |
| 2 | minor | `PRD.md` § Out of scope | SSO/SAML interaction marked out-of-scope without explaining why a customer who already SSOs would still want app-level 2FA | Add one sentence: "SSO tenants delegate auth to IdP; 2FA-enforcement-at-IdP is the customer's responsibility there. App-level 2FA in this PRD applies only to non-SSO login paths." |

### solution-architect — verdict: `changes_requested`

| # | Severity | File / Section | Finding | Fix instruction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | blocker | `ARCHITECTURE.md` § Component diagram | `auth-service` directly calls `audit-log-service` synchronously inside the login path, adding ~40ms p99 to every login | Move audit emission to async path: publish `auth.event.v1` to the existing event bus; `audit-log-service` consumes. Synchronous call pattern is reserved for security-critical paths only; audit log is observability, not security-critical |

### system-architect — verdict: `approved`

No findings. Notes that the recovery-code argon2id parameters (memory=64MiB, iterations=3, parallelism=2) align with current OWASP guidance. Approves the data-flow.

---

## Round 2 — re-review after fixes (approved)

### product-manager — verdict: `approved`

Both round-1 findings addressed. Measurement plan now points to `dashboards/auth-metrics` with a named owner. SSO scope clarification reads cleanly.

### solution-architect — verdict: `approved`

`ARCHITECTURE.md` updated: login path now publishes to `auth.event.v1`; ADR-014 added explaining the sync-vs-async decision rule. Latency budget section shows new p99 = 18ms (down from 58ms). Approves.

### system-architect — verdict: `approved`

Re-approves; no new concerns introduced by the round-1 fixes.

## Final approval signoff

| Reviewer | Verdict | Date |
|---|---|---|
| product-manager | approved | 2026-05-08 |
| solution-architect | approved | 2026-05-08 |
| system-architect | approved | 2026-05-08 |

**Design pack status: APPROVED — ready for `/develop` handoff.**

Lead: `feature-design-lead`. Pack version: `v1.0.0` (semver bumped on every approved round). Memory write: `.ai-assets-memory/designs/two-factor-authentication/final.md` updated with rubric scores and convergence trace.

## Severity scale (for reviewer reference)

- **blocker** — must fix before approval; design is unsafe, incoherent, or unimplementable as written
- **major** — must fix before GA; ships a real risk if left
- **minor** — should fix; reduces clarity or future maintenance cost
- **nit** — optional; style or wording

## Verdict scale

- `approved` — no further changes required from this reviewer
- `changes_requested` — at least one finding above `nit` severity
- `blocked` — reviewer cannot review yet (missing input artefact); record what's missing in the finding
