description: Full security scan of codebase and infrastructure — secrets, dependencies, auth, access control, data handling, cryptography, infra. Coverage against OWASP Top 10 (Web 2021) AND OWASP GenAI/LLM Top 10 (2025) per G3. Use for pre-release audit, compliance check, threat modeling. Not for code-review security feedback (use /code-review) or pen testing (use professional service).

# /security-audit — OWASP-Coverage Security Audit

Comprehensive security scan with OWASP Top 10 (Web 2021) + OWASP GenAI/LLM Top 10 (2025) coverage. Diagnostic + automated fixes for safe issues + remediation plan for the rest. **No effort estimates** — security agent does not size remediation work; user/PM owns sizing per Q2.

## When to use

- Pre-release security audit
- Compliance check (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS)
- Threat modeling exercise
- Vulnerability scan after dependency update
- Periodic (quarterly) security health check

## Not for

- Code-review security feedback (line-level) → `/code-review` (uses `code-review` skill with security-checklist companion)
- Penetration testing → professional pen-test service
- Production incident response → on-call SRE + `/analyze-prod`

## Invocation

```
/security-audit
/security-audit --scope "secrets,deps,auth" --report-type detailed
/security-audit --scope all --report-type summary
```

## Arguments

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--scope <areas>` | `all` | Comma-separated: `secrets`, `deps`, `auth`, `access-control`, `data-handling`, `crypto`, `infra` |
| `--report-type` | `summary` | `summary` (1-page exec) or `detailed` (full per-finding analysis) |

## Output

- `<repo>/.ai-assets-memory/security-audits/<run-id>/SECURITY-REPORT.md` — findings by category with severity:
  - Secrets scan (hardcoded creds, API keys) — **CRITICAL** if found
  - Dependency audit (CVE, outdated libs) — **HIGH**
  - Auth review (credentials, sessions) — **MEDIUM**
  - Access control (RBAC, data scoping) — **MEDIUM**
  - Data handling (PII exposure, encryption, logging) — **MEDIUM**
  - Cryptography (algorithm choices, key management) — **MEDIUM**
  - Infrastructure (network policies, TLS, secrets store) — **MEDIUM**
- `<repo>/.ai-assets-memory/security-audits/<run-id>/REMEDIATION-PLAN.md` — per finding: severity, mitigation steps, suggested owner role. **No effort estimate** (Q2)
- Pull request with fixes for automatable issues (dep updates, secret removal from code)

## Agent roster

| Agent | Model | Effort | Tools | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `security-engineer` | sonnet | high | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash | Main audit; threat modeling; OWASP coverage |
| `devops-engineer` | inherit | high | Bash, Read, Grep | Infrastructure security review |
| `developer` (per-stack) | inherit | medium | Read, Bash, Grep, Write, Edit | Credential/secret removal; code-level fixes for automatable issues |

## Pipeline

```
┌─ Scope parsing: audit --scope areas
│
├─ security-engineer + devops-engineer in parallel:
│  ├─ security-engineer:
│  │  - Grep for secrets (hardcoded keys, tokens, passwords) — see pii-patterns.txt
│  │  - Dependency scan (npm audit, pip check, cargo audit, etc.)
│  │  - Auth flow review (login, session, token, CSRF)
│  │  - Access control review (data scoping, RBAC)
│  │  - Cryptography review (algorithms, key rotation, TLS)
│  │  - Per OWASP coverage matrix below (G3)
│  │  → SECURITY-FINDINGS.md per scope
│  │
│  └─ devops-engineer:
│     - Infrastructure review (network policies, secrets store, TLS)
│     - Container scanning (if Docker)
│     - CI/CD security (secret management, artifact verification)
│     → INFRA-FINDINGS.md
│
├─ Lead consolidates → SECURITY-REPORT.md
│
├─ Lead generates REMEDIATION-PLAN.md:
│  └─ Per finding: severity, mitigation steps, suggested owner role
│     (NO effort estimate — user/PM owns sizing per Q2)
│
└─ developer (if applicable): fix automatable issues in a separate PR:
   - Update dependencies with security patches
   - Remove hardcoded secrets (replace with env-var refs + add to secret store)
   - Add missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS)
   Memory write: L4 audit summary; if CRITICAL → committed incident record
```

No RALF — audit is pass-once.

## OWASP coverage (G3)

Eval rubric (`plugin/eval/judge-rubrics/security-audit.md`) MUST verify coverage of: OWASP Web Top 10 (2021) + OWASP GenAI/LLM Top 10 (2025) — see `@owasp-coverage`.

If the audit target includes any AI/LLM component (agent harness, prompt template, LLM API integration, RAG pipeline), the GenAI Top 10 IS in scope by default.

## Methodology — SAST / DAST / SCA / IAST

| Approach | Surface | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **SAST** (static) | Source code at rest — dangerous APIs, taint paths, hardcoded secrets | Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube, Snyk Code |
| **DAST** (dynamic) | Running app — injection, auth bypass, header issues | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nuclei |
| **SCA** (composition) | Dependencies — known CVEs in libs + base images | osv-scanner, Snyk, Trivy, Grype, Dependabot |
| **IAST** (interactive) | Running app + instrumentation — runtime data-flow | Contrast Security, Seeker |

`security-engineer` covers SAST + SCA + secret scanning. DAST runs only when an instance is reachable (typically follow-up against staging). IAST is mention-only.

## Supply chain

SBOM tooling + SLSA levels + Cosign + EPSS/KEV patterns — see `@supply-chain-security`.

## G7 spawn payloads

All spawns use structured G7 payloads. `security-engineer` is read-only by frontmatter (`disallowedTools: Write, Edit`); developer fixes happen in a separate phase with explicit user approval.

## Eval rubric

Pointer: `plugin/eval/judge-rubrics/security-audit.md` (B10).

Dimensions:
1. **Completeness** — all requested scopes covered
2. **OWASP coverage** — Top 10 Web + GenAI Top 10 systematically addressed where applicable
3. **Accuracy** — findings are real issues, not false positives
4. **Clarity** — each finding explains the risk and impact
5. **Prioritization** — severity correctly assessed (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
6. **Remediation guidance** — mitigations are specific and testable

Pass: avg ≥ 4.0, no dimension < 3.

## Memory writes

| Layer | When | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| L4 | After audit complete | `.ai-assets-memory/security-audits/<run-id>/findings.json` — structured findings (for trend tracking) |
| L4 (committed) | If CRITICAL severity found | `.ai-assets-memory/.committed/security/incidents/<date>.md` — critical finding + immediate action taken |

`pre-tool-use-committed-write.py` hook enforces `.committed/security/incidents/*.md` matches allowlist.

## Failure modes

- **False positive (e.g., secret string in test fixture comment):** security-engineer reviews, confirms, removes from report if benign — but ALWAYS documents the false-positive review trail
- **Dependency CVE has no fix available:** documented in REMEDIATION-PLAN with risk acceptance note + escalation deadline
- **Auth flow too complex to audit in one pass:** security-engineer flags as needs-deeper-review; recommends threat-modeling session via `/spike`

## Observability events

- `workflow_start` — security-audit + scope
- `finding_identified` (per finding + severity)
- `automatable_fix_applied` (per fix in developer phase)
- `workflow_end` — `COMPLETE` with critical/high/medium/low counts

## Integration

- **Orchestrator**: `feature-design-lead`
- **Primary agent**: `security-engineer` (the B5 agent — read-only, OWASP-aware)
- **Schemas**: `plugin/schemas/spawn-payload.schema.json`, `plugin/schemas/return-contract.schema.json`
- **Sub-workflow**: developer fix phase uses `/develop` for the remediation PR
- **Companions**: `/subagent-spawn`, `/context-load`
- **Rules**: `subagent-isolation`, `untrusted-content-wrapping` (CRITICAL — audit reads project files which may have hostile content), `memory-discipline` (CRITICAL incidents → committed)
- **Hooks**: `pre-tool-use-committed-write.py` (enforces incident allowlist), `tool-output-normalize.py` (G2 on `npm audit` / `pip check` / `cargo audit` outputs)
- **Templates**: `plugin/hooks/scripts/pii-patterns.txt` (secret-pattern source)
