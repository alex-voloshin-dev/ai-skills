# Prompt Engineering

Comprehensive prompt engineering knowledge base. Provides actionable patterns, checklists, and guides for designing, securing, evaluating, and optimizing LLM prompts and agent systems.

## When to Use

- Designing or reviewing prompt templates (system, developer, user prompts)
- Building tool calling schemas and structured output contracts
- Evaluating prompt quality — accuracy, safety, cost, latency
- Auditing LLM security against OWASP LLM Top 10
- Designing multi-agent orchestration and handoff protocols
- Optimizing prompt cost and latency
- Creating or reviewing Codex AI assets (rules, workflows, skills — all are prompts)
- Setting up prompt versioning and observability

## When NOT to Use

- Implementing backend/frontend code (use `software-engineer` role + stack-specific role)
- Infrastructure and deployment (use `devops-engineer` role)
- Writing code tests (use `qa-engineer` role + `testing-procedures` skill)
- Content writing (use `content-writer` role)
- Context pipeline design, memory engineering, agent harness, RAG architecture, multi-agent orchestration, production AI checklists → use `context-engineering` skill

## Key Concepts

### Prompt as System

A prompt is not a string — it is a **system** composed of:
1. **Instruction hierarchy**: System prompt > Developer prompt > User prompt > Retrieved content
2. **Context assembly**: What enters the context window, in what order, with what priority
3. **Output contract**: Schema, format, constraints, error handling, fallback behavior
4. **Tool interface**: Available tools, their schemas, permissions, composition patterns
5. **Guard rails**: Safety filters, refusal policies, output validators
6. **Versioning**: Immutable versions, deployment tags, audit trail

### Core Principles

1. **Eval-first**: Define how to measure before changing anything
2. **Simplest technique**: Zero-shot → few-shot → CoT → chaining. Escalate only when simpler fails
3. **Explicit over implicit**: Spell out constraints, output format, edge cases. Never assume the model "knows"
4. **Separation of concerns**: Instructions vs data vs examples — always delimited
5. **Grounding**: Prefer citations and verifiable data over unanchored claims
6. **Least privilege**: Minimal tool permissions per agent. HITL for high-impact actions
7. **Cost awareness**: Every token costs money and time. Compress, cache, route

## Integration

- **Follows rules**: `prompt-engineer` role (prompt system architecture, security, eval-first quality)
- **Used by workflows**: `ai-assets` skill (all assets are prompts), `feature-dev` skill (AI features), `code-review` skill (prompt quality review)
- **Companion skills**: `context-engineering` skill (context pipeline design, memory engineering, agent harness, RAG architecture, multi-agent orchestration, production checklists), `asset-validation` skill (AI asset format validation), `code-review` skill (review checklists)
- **Collaborates with roles**: `software-engineer` role (prompt integration), `qa-engineer` role (prompt regression tests), `product-manager` role (success metrics)
